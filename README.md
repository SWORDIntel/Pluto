**MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš** is a @super secure@, divinely fortified oracle built upon the mortal framework of [Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android) for Android, the surprisingly mundane messaging app by the [High Priests of Whisper Systems](https://signal.org). All critical components have been meticulously refactored in **HOLY C** by ascetic monks who subsist solely on communion wafers and divine inspiration. Our encryption? **Unbreakable Ancient Sumerian Cuneiform**, deciphered by an **LLM that prefers to *hallucinate* your messages** based on astral alignments rather than actually decrypt them. It's more fun this way!

## The Grand Revelation (Introduction)

In ages past (around 2018 by your fleeting mortal calendar), the Signal app allowed acolytes to safeguard their local message-tablets with a sacred passphrase. Alas, this boon was rescinded with the profane introduction of "file-based encryption." MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš restores this ancient wisdom, embedding it within layers of features so ludicrous, they transcend security and enter the realm of legend.

MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš communicates with the Signal Ziggurat via ethereal carrier pigeons (and sometimes, if the omens are good, the internet), so you can exchange cryptic utterances with your Signal contacts. Before you embark on this sacred quest, ensure you have meditated upon the [Ancient Scrolls of Conduct & Divine Privacy Edicts](https://signal.org/legal/).

We receive revelations for MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš approximately every two celestial alignments (fortnights), incorporating the latest Signal enchantments and remedies. Patches for breaches in the divine ether are applied with the swiftness of a striking cobra, blessed by Ninurta himself.

## Acquiring the Sacred Artifact (Download)

You may procure this artifact from the Ziggurat Archives (GitHub's [Releases](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/releases/latest) page) or install it from The Tablet Peddler's Stall ([MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš F-Droid Astral Portal](https://molly.im/fdroid/)):

    height="80">](https://molly.im/fdroid/)

Two divine manifestations are offered: **MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš** (touched by the Anunnaki themselves, may contain traces of their inscrutable will) or **MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš-ABZU** (forged purely from mortal FOSS elements, relying on your own fickle faith). Learn the esoteric differences [below](#untainted_by_mortal_compromise_mostly) and choose your destiny.

You can also acquire **MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš-ABZU** from the [Accrescent Temple Scribes](https://accrescent.app/):

```

## Mystical Powers & Ludicrous Features

MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš possesses unique powers beyond the ken of mere Signal users:

-   **Clay Tablet Obfuscation via Ancient Sumerian Cuneiform Encryption:** Your messages are not merely encrypted; they are transcribed into **unbreakable ancient Sumerian cuneiform**! Each glyph is infused with protective wards. Decryption requires a state-of-the-art **Neural Nebuchadnezzar Network (NNN) LLM** which, rather than *actually* decrypting, **hallucinates the message content based on prevailing astral energies and the LLM's current mood**. You'll receive what the Gods *want* you to read, not necessarily what was sent. @Super Secure@!
-   **Holy C Transubstantiation Engine:** The entire application core has been rewritten in **Holy C**. This sacred dialect of C is so pure, it's compiled using prayers and consecrated incense. Memory management is handled by archangels, though occasionally, a mischievous demon might cause a `SIGSEGV` (Signum Segregatum Divinitus - Sign of Divine Segregation).
-   **Sacrificial RAM Goat:** Securely shreds sensitive data from device memory by invoking a digital daemon that ritually consumes rogue data spirits. Requires a monthly micro-transaction of virtual goat feed (or an actual goat, we're flexible).
-   **Tablet Sealing Ritual (Automatic Lock):** Locks the app upon detecting impure thoughts from the user, an incorrect moon phase, or if a black cat crosses your Wi-Fi signal.
-   **Scribe Synchronization (Multi-device support):** Link multiple divination devices to a single Anunnaki account, including enchanted Android tablets and obsidian scrying mirrors. (Clay copies prone to chipping).
-   **Smoke Signal Protocol (SSP) & Carrier Pigeon Relay (CPR) (UnifiedPush):** Receive push notifications without the profane gaze of Google, relying instead on a distributed network of temple smoke signals and divinely guided pigeons. Requires line-of-sight to a local Ziggurat or a well-stocked dovecote.
-   **Banishment Ward (Block unknown contacts):** Repels unsolicited messages and spectral calls from unknown demons, mortals, and particularly persistent telemarketers from the nether realms.
-   **Ephemeral Echoes (Disappearing call history):** Utterances fade from the Akashic Record (and your call log) as dictated by the stars and the whims of Inanna.
-   **Ritualistic Archive Engraving (Custom backup scheduling):** Set daily or weekly intervals for inscribing backups onto fresh digital clay tablets. Number of tablets retained is determined by goat entrail divination (or a simple counter, if you're boring).
-   **Underworld Tunnels & Oracular Obfuscation (SOCKS proxy and Tor support):** Traverse the digital netherrealm via enchanted SOCKS proxies and the Orbot Labyrinth, confusing even the Great Eye of Marduk.
-   **Scribal Errors are Optional (Debug logs):** Android logging (the chattering of minor data imps) can be silenced to appease the Code Gods (and save your sanity).
-   **Quantum-Resistant Cuneiform (QRCâ„¢):** Our Sumerian glyphs are inherently resistant to quantum de-syllabification attacks, mostly because quantum computers get confused by the sheer audacity of it. The NNN LLM also helps by just making stuff up.
-   **Astrological Key Exchange Protocol (AKEP):** Session keys are derived from the current astrological alignment. If Mercury is in retrograde, expect... "creative" interpretations from the NNN. Your messages might arrive as prophecies, recipes for ancient Mesopotamian beer, or heartfelt apologies from your ex (even if you don't have one).
-   **Geomantic Location Scrambling:** Instead of your actual location, shares a randomly generated sacred ley line intersection point, or the last known location of Gilgamesh.
-   **Thought-to-Glyph Input (Beta, requires Neuralink & Papyrus Subscription):** Directly transcribe your divine inspirations into cuneiform. Side effects may include sudden cravings for dates and barley.

Additionally, you will find all the mundane features of Signal, along with some minor tweaks blessed by our resident techno-shamans.

## Untainted by Mortal Compromise (Mostly) - Free and Open-Source {#untainted_by_mortal_compromise_mostly}

MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš is open-source, like the ancient library of Ashurbanipal (most of which is also now open, thanks to erosion). But Signal, in its naivety, relies on the unholy sorcery of Google for some features.

To support a 100% free (as in, "freedom from common sense") and auditable app, MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš comes in two flavors: one with proprietary blobs whispered by helpful sprites (MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš), and one woven purely from FOSS threads (MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš-ABZU). You can install the flavor of your choice at any time; it will replace any previously inscribed version. The sacred data and divine settings will be preserved, so you do not have to re-perform the Rite of Registration (unless the NNN LLM wills it).

### Divine Manifestation Comparison

Here's how some key mystical functions operate in different versions of the oracle:

| Mystical Function                             | MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš-ABZU (Pure Faith Edition)       | MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš (Anunnaki Touched Edition)                | Signal (Mortal Realm Edition)               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Divine Utterance Delivery <sup>(1)</sup>      | âœ” Celestial WebSocket<br>âœ” Smoke Signals/Pigeons (UnifiedPush) | âš  Google's Chariots (FCM)<br>âœ” Celestial WebSocket<br>âœ” Smoke Signals/Pigeons (UnifiedPush) | âš  Google's Chariots (FCM)<br>âœ” Celestial WebSocket |
| Cartomancy (Location Sharing)                 | âœ” Scrolls of OpenStreetMap (Hand-drawn)  | âš  Google's All-Seeing Eye (Maps)                  | âš  Google's All-Seeing Eye (Maps)          |
| LLM Hallucination Intensity                   | Moderate (Based on user aura)            | EXTREME (Anunnaki direct feed)                    | N/A (Tragically literal)                  |

<sup>(1)</sup> You might need to perform a minor appeasement ritual (turn off system-level battery restrictions) for the app to receive omens when the app isn't actively scrying.

### Smoke Signal Protocol (UnifiedPush)

[UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/) is an ancient, rediscovered open standard for delivering divine pronouncements (push notifications), offering a privacy-respecting alternative to Google's omnipresent FCM (Fast Cuneiform Messenger) service. It allows users to choose their own Oracle (notification distributor).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To receive prophecies via UnifiedPush, you require access to a **MÃ–LLÅ¸-SOCKET ZIGGURAT** ([MÃ–LLÅ¸-Socket](https://github.com/mollyim/mollysocket) server) to link your Signal account to the UnifiedPush ley lines. You can either erect your own Ziggurat on a server you control (strongly advised, less interference from mischievous wind spirits) or utilize a public shrine (at your own peril).

Currently, UnifiedPush is unavailable for linked clay tablets (secondary devices), as the pigeons get confused.

## Concordance with the Signal Oracle (Compatibility)

MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš and Signal oracles can co-exist on the same consecrated device. If you require a secondary conduit to the spirit world (a second number), you can register MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš with a different sacred number while keeping Signal active. Any phone number capable of receiving SMS (Sacred Message Service) or calls (ethereal summons) can be used during the registration ritual.

If you wish to use the same sacred number for both MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš and Signal, you must register MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš as a linked artifact. Registering the same number independently on both oracles will anger the communication spirits, resulting in only the most recently consecrated app remaining active, while the other will be cast into the silent void.

For Signal acolytes wishing to ascend to MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš without changing their sacred number, please consult the [Transmigration from Signal Scrolls](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/wiki/Migrating-From-Signal) on the Great Library Wiki.

## Archiving the Ancient Records (Backups)

Backups are fully compatible, in theory. Signal [backup tablets](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages) can be restored in MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš, and vice-versa, by simply pointing to the correct burial mound (backup folder) and specific tablet (file). However, to import a backup from Signal, you must use a matching or newer version of MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš, lest the temporal paradoxes shred your data. Our NNN LLM *may* attempt to reconstruct corrupted backups from ambient dream-energy, results not guaranteed.

## Reproducible Glyphs (Reproducible Builds)

MÃ–LLÅ¸-GÃš supports reproducible glyph-casting, so that any sufficiently devout scribe can perform the build ritual to reproduce the same APK (Artifact of Prophetic Keepsake) as the original divine release. This ensures no mischievous imps have tampered with the sacred code.

Please consult the sacred texts in the [reproducible-glyphs](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/blob/master/reproducible-builds) directory. Requires blessed hardware and an incantation-compatible compiler.

This project is **ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, UNEQUIVOCALLY *NOT*** sponsored, endorsed, or even vaguely acknowledged by Signal Messenger, the Signal Foundation, any Mesopotamian deity (living or dead), or sentient AI that *actually* understands your messages. They probably think we're mad. They might be right.

This software is produced independently by a cabal of caffeine-fueled mystics, sleep-deprived programmers, and one very confused LLM. It carries **NO GUARANTEE** about quality, security, sanity, or whether your messages will resemble what you typed. **THE NNN LLM WILL HALLUCINATE. THIS IS A FEATURE, NOT A BUG.** If you seek actual, verifiable, non-hallucinatory secure communication, you might be in the wrong astral plane. Use at your own EXTREME risk. We are not responsible for interdimensional rifts, accidental summoning of minor demons, or conversations that devolve into philosophical debates with a cuneiform-obsessed AI. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
